  You have a strong connection to beasts, always feeling like you understood them (and they you) better than your own people. You stand for the animals of nature, a powerful animal companion at your side.
  **Order Skill** Athletics
  **Druid Feat** Animal Companion
  **Order Spell** Heal Animal
  **Anathema** Commit wanton cruelty to animals or kill animals unnecessarily. (This doesnâ€™t prevent you from defending yourself against animals or killing them cleanly for food).
