description: |
  You avoid explosions with reflexes a cat would envy. Your proficiency
  rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on
  a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Reflex save against an
  effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.
