description: |
  You command powerful magic, not through study or devotion, but as an agent for an otherworldly patron that even you don't entirely understand. This entity might be a covert divinity, a powerful fey, an ancient spirit, or any other mighty supernatural beingâ€”but its nature is likely as much a mystery to you as it is to others. Through a special familiar, your patron grants you versatile spells and powerful hexes to use as you see fit, though you're never certain if you're merely serving your patron's larger plan.
