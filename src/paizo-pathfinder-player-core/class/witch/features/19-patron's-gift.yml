description: |
  Your patron grants you the power to command incredible works of magic. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using witch spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Patron's Truth feat to gain a second slot.
